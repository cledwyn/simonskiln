UI page for the Data Logger project.  I will have the data up soonish about the parts there were used.

To make this run

 * Install Composer for PHP (just 'cuz I'm lazy and firebase libraries make it easier)  Dont really need for consumption front end.
 * composer install
 * should be good.  Firebase will read from anywhere.
